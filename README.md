# Mini-Q-A-over-My-Notes

A **simple but powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) demo** using **FAISS**, **Flan-T5**, and **LangChain**.  
This project allows users to **ask questions about any text/notes** and get **context-aware answers**, combining a vector database with a language model.

## **Demo**

Live Streamlit demo: [https://mini-q-a-over-my-notes-yonjq535fdrp4qgiirsoyo.streamlit.app](https://mini-q-a-over-my-notes-yonjq535fdrp4qgiirsoyo.streamlit.app)

---

## **Features**

- **RAG pipeline**: retrieves relevant chunks from your notes using FAISS and generates answers with Flan-T5.  
- **Interactive UI**: built with Streamlit.  
- **Top-k slider**: control how many chunks are retrieved for each question.  
- **Modular backend**: `RAGService` separates embeddings, retrieval, and generation.

## **Installation / Running Locally**

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Harithalakshmikt/Mini-Q-A-over-My-Notes.git
cd Mini-Q-A-over-My-Notes
```

2. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Streamlit app:

python -m streamlit run app.py

How It Works

-` Load Notes → notes.txt is split into chunks and embedded using HuggingFace embeddings.

-` Store in FAISS → all chunks are stored in a vector database for similarity search.

Ask a Question → user input is converted to embedding and matched with top-k relevant chunks.

Generate Answer → Flan-T5 uses the retrieved chunks as context to generate an answer.

Example

Notes content: Activist is being taken to Jodhpur. Internet services suspended, curfew continues in Leh.

Question: “Where is the activist being taken?”

Retrieved chunks: “Activist is being taken to Jodhpur.”

Generated answer: “The activist is being taken to Jodhpur.”
